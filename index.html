                        In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process.
                         Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, 
                         all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem.</p>

                         in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human
                          would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm. High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the
                           Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it.</p>

                            On the other side is Hellsing, an organization dedicated to destroying these supernatural forces that threaten the very existence 
                            of humanity. At its head is Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who commands a powerful military and spends her life fighting the undead.
